#Checkpoint 1: tentative project outline

###Outline: 
I intend do a transcription, text encoding and what might be deemed a '[close reading](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_reading)' of the text of a small selection of historical newspaper articles/pages from one historical newspaper. I have not yet picked the newspaper in question (I would prefer to do a very small local newspaper, such as the Westport Mirror or the Perth Courier [two towns I grew up near], but these papers do not appear to have been digitized or archived on the web), but will probably pick either the Ottawa Citizen or the Ottawa Times.

I love local history, and am interested in morbid stuff like obituaries and cemetaries, so might choose to focus on the death notices in a couple of editions of the paper. At this point I have a cloudy notion of somehow honouring the forgotten dead of the past or trying to locate geneological information about the individuals, or of noting how many women died in childbirth in a particular geographic area or something like that.

I also noticed--with sadness and amusement--that in the one 1820's digitized Ottawa Citizen there is a page intended 'For Mother and the Wee Ones' or something like that, which includes some words games, cartoons and so forth for children, and house-keeping and beauty tips for women. I'm not sure what I would do with that, but it caught my interest. 

###Method: 
I will be first transcribing and then encoding an article or small selection of articles. I have a picture in my head of building a tiny web of information with all these links branching off to people, events, locations, etc. I know I have to pick some subject to focus on, but at this point, I haven't figured out what that will be.

One of the reasons that I'd prefer a very small newspaper is that one issue would provide the possibility of sort of re-creating a snapshot in time for that one small, localized area--like who died that week, what events happened, where they happened, what global or non-local events were going on at that time, etc).

A second aspect of my project would of course be that it would be providing a transcribed and text-encoded version of the newspaper article(s), which could then easily be used for future analysis, either by me or someone else.

###Primary Data Source(s):

I will be using a historical newspaper from the [Google News Archives](http://news.google.com/newspapers) (as mentioned above, probably an Ottawa paper if I can't track down a digitized version of a smaller local paper).

###Secondary Data Source(s):

A lot of the discourse surrounding close reading seems to be in the realm of literary criticism or, judging by my Google search results, it is used rather loosely to mean getting kids in school to be able to develop better skills in reading analysis. I don't think that my project would be considered a close reading in either of these way, as it won't be focused on literature or bettering my reading comprehension, but on a newspaper.

One source that give a detailed background of the history and some of the theory behind close reading is
Close Reading: the Reader, by Frank Lentricchia and Andrew DuBois (Duke University Press, 2003). Again, this is focused exclusively on literary criticism, so I'm not sure how applicable it will be to my project, but I think it would give me a greater understanding of the theory behind the concept.

I found [this article on close reading](http://www.criticalthinking.org/pages/the-art-of-close-reading-part-three/511) more helpful/ relevant to what I'm intending to do.  My understanding of the type of close reading that I would be doing as part of my project would be sort of connecting the tiny details (and providing background information on them via TEI) to the larger context (the community/newspaper in question).
