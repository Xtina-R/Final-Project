"Built between 1860 ansd 1861 at the corner of Queen St. and George St., Fishermen's Hall was originally an exhibition centre for fisheries and agricultural produce. Interestingly, until 1872 it also served as a theatre. Subsequently, it was used as a Catholic church, and as the Sisters of Mercy school. The rear corners, window openings, and door frames of the building were efficiently trimmed with brick in order to reduce the amount of delicate cutting and fitting of stone."
